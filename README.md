# Shell Internship Project ( Edunet Foundation) 
E-waste generation classification :-

The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate and dependable E-Waste Image Classification model for categorizing electronic waste based on visual data. This advanced model will leverage transfer learning with the EfficientNetV2B0 algorithm, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network. Automating e-waste identification will facilitate efficient sorting and recycling, representing a pivotal advancement towards a circular economy for electronics, promoting environmental stewardship, and safeguarding public health.

The project utilized a folder-based image classification dataset comprising images of 10 e-waste categories: PCB, Player, Battery, Microwave, Mobile, Mouse, Printer, Television, Washing Machine, and Keyboard.

The dataset was organized into three directories:

Train/: 2,400 images (240 images per class).
Validation/: 300 images (30 images per class).
Test/: 300 images (30 images per class).

All classes are equally balanced across the training, validation, and test sets, ensuring no class bias during model training or evaluation. Dataset Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshat103/e-waste-image-dataset
